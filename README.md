# TYPING DUEL

### I STARTED THIS PROJECT TO LEARN FIREBASE

### After learning the performance of real time database, i realize it will be valid for real time multiplayer typing competition/duel, so I changed the name to TYPING DUEL

### IT WAS ONE OF MY VERY FIRST PROJECTS, THE CODES ARE UNPROFESSIONAL, HARD TO READ AND MAINTAIN

### FEEL FREE TO CLONE AND PLAY AROUND WITH IT

### I MAY CLEAN THE CODE LATER
